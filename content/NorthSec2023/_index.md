[NorthSec 2023](https://nsec.io) happened May 19-21 in Montreal, Canada. There were 76 teams of 8 people each, so the competition was fierce.

I competed with [cold_root](https://ctftime.org/team/120482), and spent most of the time working on hardware reverse engineering challenges, so these write-ups will cover those.

Challenges I attempted:
- [Candy Machine](candy-machine)
- [Reversing the Xtensa ESP32](challenge_led-0)
- [Badge LED Challenge 1](challenge_led-1)
- [Badge LED Challenge 2](challenge_led-2)
- [Badge LED Challenge 3](challenge_led-3)
