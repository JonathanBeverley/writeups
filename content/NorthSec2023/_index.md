[NorthSec 2023](https://nsec.io) happened May 19-21 in Montreal, Canada. There were 76 teams of 8 people each, so the competition was fierce.

I competed with [cold_root](https://ctftime.org/team/120482), and spent most of the time working on hardware reverse engineering challenges, so these write-ups will cover those.
